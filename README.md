## Short Bio
Brazilian born in Minas Gerais, I've spent most of my life in Belo Horizonte. This is the capital of Minas Gerais, a state known for its mountains, good food and warm people. I left it in 2016 to move to Germany, where I lived in Aachen (North Rhine Westphalen) and Saarlouis (Saarland).

I like to spent my free time cozy with my family - cooking, gardening, playing video games or reading a book. I also enjoy learning new languages and I am now trying to learn japanese.
